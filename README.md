## My process

As with all projects from Frontend Mentor, I use a decomposition method where I look at the provided design and then break it into the individual pieces and identify HTML elements I want to use. I then set up my css or other files and get to work. 

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was a nice practice for me to see how quickly I could construct the layout that matched the design. Not sure if I learned any new techniques or processes, but it was still a nice challenge to practice my current skills. 

### Continued development

I think I should try to use a different technique to create this layout... possibly DOM or something like Bootstrap to get more practice with those tools.  

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - As always, I used the MDN resource when I had a quick question.
